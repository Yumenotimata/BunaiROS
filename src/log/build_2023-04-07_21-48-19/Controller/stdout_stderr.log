CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsensor_megs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "sensor_megs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "sensor_megs" with
  any of the following names:

    sensor_megsConfig.cmake
    sensor_megs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sensor_megs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "sensor_megs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "sensor_megs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
